# What is in your belly button
## Objective
The objective of this exercise is to create a visualization of bacteria data that is extracted from a number of volunteer's belly buttons. We gave each volunteer an ID number to keep their identities anonymous, then tracked the top 10 bacteria per person's belly button. In this, we are trying to identify a bacteria for Improbable Beef, to see if there was a species of bacteria that could replicate beef. 
<br>
In this, we are looking at 3 different sets of data. First set is what are the 10 most prolific bacteria growing in a persons navel, what the samples look like per culture, and frequency of washing their belly button. We have generated a website (https://benlew3.github.io/belly_bacteria/) where the volunteer can cross-reference their ID number to check out the data that has been gathered. the website itself should be mobile friendly as well as viewable on a computer.

Here is a screenshot of what the website looks like:
